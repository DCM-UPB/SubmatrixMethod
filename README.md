# Submatrix Method

This repository contains a prototype implementation of the submatrix method,
used to approximately calculate inverse p-th roots of large sparse matrices,
spreading the work over many compute nodes using MPI.

Details about the method, it's applicability in different applications and an
evaluation of it's performance and scalability can be found in our publication:
