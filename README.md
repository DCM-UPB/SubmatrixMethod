# Submatrix Method

This repository contains a prototypic implementation of the submatrix
method, used to approximately calculate inverse p-th roots of large
sparse matrices, distributing the workload over many compute nodes
using MPI.

Details about the method, its applicability in different applications
and an evaluation of its performance and scalability can be found in
our scientific publication:
